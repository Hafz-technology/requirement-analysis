# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
* Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
* Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
* Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
* Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
* Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
* Requirement Gathering
* Requirement Elicitation
* Requirement Documentation
* Requirement Analysis and Modeling
* Requirement Validation.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
* Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
* User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
* Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
* Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
### Non-functional Requirements
* Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
* Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
* Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
* Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
* Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.
## Acceptance Criteria.
### Importance of Acceptance Criteria:

* Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
* Provide a basis for testing and validation.
* Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.

### an example of acceptance criteria
Users should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.
